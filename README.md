# MSSecurityUpdates
Hacked together script (with hardcoded variables! eurgh) to grab csv of monthly MS patch rollup.

Will need to install MSrcSecurityUpdates module from https://github.com/microsoft/MSRC-Microsoft-Security-Updates-API

Will also need to create an APIkey. Create one at the Developer area at https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance. Sign in with an outlook.com account (create one if necessary), then plug the API key into the script.

Apologies for the hardcoded stuff, it does what I needed it to do with minimal effort.
